    "description": "This application is written in Python3 language and uses the Mikado software (https://www.seadatanet.org/Software/MIKADO). The architecture of the workflow is based on a MySQL database containing information about data and metadata. The application is designed for High Frequency Radar (HFR) data management according to the European HFR node processing workflow, thus generating radial and total velocity aggregated datasets in netCDF format complying with the European standard data and metadata model for HFR current data and the related Common Data Index (CDI) files according to SeaDataNet requirements.",
